# 🧭 How to Use This Dashboard

This dashboard is designed to be intuitive and interactive, allowing users to explore sales performance from multiple angles. Here’s how to get the most out of it:

### **1. Use the Slicers to Filter Data**
On the left side of the dashboard, you can filter results by:
- **Customer Type** (Loyal, Occasional)  
- **Store Location** (Berlin, Cologne, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich)  
- **Product Category** (Accessories, Apparel, Electronics, Furniture, Office Supplies)

These filters instantly update all charts and KPIs, enabling targeted analysis.

### **2. Explore Category Performance**
The donut chart helps you quickly understand which product categories contribute most to revenue.  
Hover over each segment to see exact values and percentages.

### **3. Analyse Sales Trends Over Time**
The line chart shows monthly sales across two years.  
Use it to:
- Identify seasonal peaks  
- Spot declining or growing periods  
- Compare year‑over‑year performance  

### **4. Compare Store Locations**
The bar chart highlights how each store is performing.  
This is useful for:
- Regional strategy planning  
- Identifying underperforming locations  
- Allocating resources effectively  

### **5. Evaluate Discount Effectiveness**
The discount impact chart compares sales before and after discounts.  
Use this to understand:
- Whether discounts are driving meaningful uplift  
- Which months respond best to promotions  
- How discounting affects revenue quality

# 📝 Project Description

This project presents a fully interactive **Sales Performance Dashboard** built in Excel, designed to demonstrate practical data analytics capabilities. The dashboard transforms raw transactional data into meaningful business insights through structured data cleaning, modelling, and visual storytelling. It enables users to explore sales trends, customer behaviour, product category performance, and discount impact across multiple store locations.

The goal of this project is to showcase end‑to‑end analytical thinking — from preparing the dataset to designing KPIs and building a dashboard that supports real‑world decision‑making. It reflects industry‑aligned skills used in business intelligence, retail analytics, and performance reporting.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Retail businesses often struggle to understand how different factors — such as customer type, product category, store location, and discounting — influence overall sales performance. Without a consolidated view, decision‑makers face challenges like:

- Identifying which product categories drive the most revenue  
- Understanding seasonal or monthly sales fluctuations  
- Measuring the effectiveness of discounts  
- Comparing performance across store locations  
- Segmenting customers based on purchasing behaviour  

This project addresses these challenges by building a dashboard that brings all these insights together in a single, interactive interface. It enables stakeholders to quickly identify trends, diagnose performance issues, and make data‑driven decisions.

# 🔍 Key Insights From the Dashboard

This dashboard reveals several important insights about sales performance, customer behaviour, and product trends across the business:

### **1. Electronics Dominate Revenue**
With **86% of total sales**, Electronics is by far the strongest category.  
This indicates:
- High customer demand  
- Strong product‑market fit  
- Potential for deeper segmentation (e.g., premium vs. budget electronics)

Other categories contribute marginally, suggesting opportunities for diversification or targeted marketing.

---

### **2. Strong Year‑over‑Year Growth**
The business achieved **84.8% YoY growth**, signalling:
- Successful sales strategies  
- Effective customer acquisition or retention  
- Strong market conditions  

This growth trend is visible across most months in the sales timeline.

---

### **3. Seasonal Sales Patterns**
The monthly sales trend shows:
- Noticeable peaks during certain months  
- Dips that may align with off‑season periods or reduced promotions  

Understanding these patterns can help optimise inventory, staffing, and marketing campaigns.

---

### **4. Munich and Berlin Lead Store Performance**
Among all store locations:
- **Munich and Berlin** consistently generate the highest sales  
- **Hamburg and Frankfurt** show moderate performance  
- **Cologne** trails behind  

This suggests potential for:
- Targeted promotions in lower‑performing regions  
- Resource allocation based on store contribution  

---

### **5. Discounts Have a Mixed Impact**
The discount analysis shows:
- Discounts do increase sales in some months  
- But in others, the uplift is minimal  

This indicates that discounting is **not uniformly effective**, and a more data‑driven pricing strategy could improve profitability.

---

### **6. Loyal Customers Drive Higher Value**
Filtering by customer type reveals:
- Loyal customers tend to generate higher order values  
- Occasional customers contribute volume but not necessarily revenue efficiency  

This highlights the importance of loyalty programmes and retention strategies.

---

### **7. Average Order Value (AOV) Is Strong**
With an **AOV of 653 €**, the business is performing well in terms of revenue per transaction.  
This suggests:
- Customers are purchasing higher‑value items  
- Bundling or upselling strategies may already be effective

# 🚀 Future Enhancements

This project can be expanded in several meaningful ways to increase analytical depth and business value:

### **1. Add Customer Segmentation**
Introduce segmentation based on:
- Purchase frequency  
- Average order value  
- Product preferences  
- Demographics (if available)

This would enable more personalised insights.

### **2. Integrate Forecasting Models**
Using Excel or Python, add:
- Monthly sales forecasts  
- Category‑level predictions  
- Discount elasticity modelling  

This would turn the dashboard into a forward‑looking tool.

### **3. Include Profitability Metrics**
Enhance the dashboard with:
- Gross margin  
- Net profit  
- Profit by category or store  

This would shift the focus from revenue to true business performance.

### **4. Automate Data Refresh**
If the dataset updates regularly, consider:
- Power Query automation  
- Scheduled refresh workflows  
- Connection to external data sources  

This would make the dashboard production‑ready.

### **5. Build a Power BI Version**
A Power BI version could include:
- Drill‑through pages  
- Advanced DAX measures  
- Interactive tooltips  
- Mobile‑friendly layouts  

This would elevate the project to enterprise‑grade analytics.
